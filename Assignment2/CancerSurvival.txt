The main changes I made was adding labels. Outside of adding the typical labels of a title and indication of 5, 10, 15, and 20 years - 
I added label tracking the lines on the other side. I think the graph can get particularlly confusing if you are trying to track one line 
across the graph. With my implementation, now you have a start and an endpoint for the graph, one which indicates the name, and the other 
which indicates the amount changed over the 20 year period. 
So for lines like prostate with a huge drop, you can easily follow it through the percentage change on the right. 
There was also no "values" on the Y axis that indicated the percent. I added the percent on the line for each of the of the different
types of cancer at each of the year markers. This gives the consumer a better grasp on the cancer and the percent survival rate for each.
